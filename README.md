# CodSoft-Task-2

I am a Full Stack Developer with expertise in both front-end and back-end development, skilled at building dynamic, responsive web applications.
On the front-end, I have strong proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript frameworks such as React.js and Vue.js, ensuring that user interfaces are intuitive,
visually appealing, and optimized for performance. I excel in creating interactive user experiences with a focus on accessibility and cross-browser compatibility.

For back-end development, I am experienced in server-side technologies like Node.js, Express, and Python (Django, Flask), allowing me to develop robust APIs,
manage databases, and handle authentication/authorization. My database management skills include SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB), ensuring seamless data
storage and retrieval. I also have experience deploying applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Docker, while maintaining CI/CD pipelines for automated
testing and continuous integration.

My development process emphasizes Agile methodology, version control (Git),
and best practices in both security and code quality. With a holistic understanding of the full
development cycle, I can collaborate effectively with designers, developers, and product teams to deliver end-to-end solutions.
